# üìù What is a Chatbot?

A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone.
Chatbot applications streamline interactions between people and services, enhancing customer experience. At the same time, they offer companies new opportunities to improve the customers engagement process and operational efficiency by reducing the typical cost of customer service.

# üö¶ Types of Chatbots:

Chatbots, like regular applications, have application layers, databases, conversational user interfaces (CUIs) and APIs. There are 3 common kinds of a chatbot available today:

>> Rule-based chatbots: The most straightforward option, these bots simply provide a pre-defined answer to very specific questions. These bots are great for things like qualifying leads or offering customers an interactive FAQ experience.

>> Intelligent chatbots: These intelligent bots use machine learning or ‚ÄúML‚Äù to learn from the user‚Äôs requests and information. Intellectual bots are trained to understand specific words and phrases that trigger a reply. They teach themselves over time to understand more questions and deliver better answers.

>> AI-powered chatbots: These bots combine the benefits of rule-based bots with the power of intellectually independent programs to solve user problems. They can remember the context of conversations and understand user preferences. These bots use a combination of natural language processing, machine learning, and AI to understand customers. Natural language processing helps the interactions between humans and computers to feel more natural.

# üìà How do Bots and Chatbots Work?

There are 3 fundamental classification methods used to run a chatbot.

The first option is to create a pattern-matching bot. Pattern-matching bots classify text and produce a response based on the keywords they see. A standard structure for these patterns is AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language). In pattern-matching, the chatbot only knows answers to questions that exist in their models. The bot cannot go beyond the patterns already implemented into its system.

Another option for today‚Äôs chatbots is to use algorithms. For each kind of question, a unique pattern needs to be available in a database for the bot to provide the right response. With various combinations of trends, it‚Äôs possible to create a hierarchical structure. Algorithms are how developers reduce the classifiers and make the structure more manageable. The classic algorithm for NLP and text classification is Multinational Na√Øve Bayes.

The final crucial methodology for chatbots is to use artificial neural networks. These are solutions that give the bots a way to calculate the response to a question using weighted connections and context in data. With artificial neural networks, each sentence provided to a bot is broken down into different words, and each word is used as an input for the neural network. Over time, the neural network becomes stronger and more advanced, helping the bot to create a more accurate set of responses to common queries.
